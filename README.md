# Non-Functional Requirements Classification
The current release of MARC supports a new functionality to extract Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) from user reviews. The reviews are classified into four major NFR classes: Dependability, Performance, Supportability, and Usability. The classification is achieved in two steps: 1) Reviews carrying NFR information are first isolated using binary classification, and 2) Dictionary Matching is used to classify user reviews into the four different NFR categories. Users have the option to select their own training dataset and customize the classification dictionary.
Please make sure that the custom training file and dictionary file match the format provided in the source code. The custom files must be added to the folder: C:/Users/name/AppData/Roaming/MARC 3.0/InputData/TrainingDataset"
